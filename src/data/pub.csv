1,2016,INFORMS Journal on Computing,Computing Near-Optimal Stable Cost Allocations for Cooperative Games by Lagrangian Relaxation,"Lindong Liu, Xiangtong Qi*, Zhou Xu","For a cost-sharing cooperative game with an empty core, we study the problem of calculating a near-optimal cost allocation that satisfies coalitional stability constraints and maximizes the total cost allocated to all players. One application of such a problem is finding the minimum level of subsidy required to stabilize the grand coalition. To obtain solutions, we propose a new generic framework based on Lagrangian relaxation, which has several advantages over existing work that exclusively relies on linear programming (LP) relaxation techniques. Our approach can generate better cost allocations than LP-based algorithms, and is also applicable to a broader range of problems. To illustrate the efficiency and performance of the Lagrangian relaxation framework, we investigate two different facility location games. The results demonstrate that our new approach can find better cost allocations than the LP-based algorithm, or provide alternative optimal cost allocations for cases that the LP-based algorithm can also solve to optimality.",game theory; cooperative game; cost allocation; Lagrangian relaxation; facility location game,https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.2016.0707
2,2018,Operations Research,Simultaneous Penalization and Subsidization for Stabilizing Grand Cooperation,"Lindong Liu, Xiangtong Qi*, Zhou Xu","In this paper we propose a new instrument, a simultaneous penalization and subsidization, for stabilizing the grand coalition and enabling cooperation among all players of an unbalanced cooperative game. The basic idea is to charge a penalty z from players who leave the grand coalition, and at the same time provide a subsidy ω to players who stay in the grand coalition. To formalize this idea, we establish a penalty-subsidy function ω(z) based on a linear programming model, which allows a decision maker to quantify the trade-off between the levels of penalty and subsidy. By studying function ω(z), we identify certain properties of the trade-off. To implement the new instrument, we design two algorithms to construct function ω(z) and its approximation. Both algorithms rely on solving the value of ω(z) for any given z, for which we propose two effective solution approaches. We apply the new instrument to a class of machine scheduling games,
showing its wide applicability.","cooperative game, grand coalition stability, simultaneous penalization and subsidization, parallel machine scheduling game",https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2018.1723

（共同一作）","This study examines two types of crowdfunding mechanisms, namely, the fixed and the flexible funding mechanisms. Under the fixed funding mechanism, the pledges are returned to the backers if the crowdfunding project fails (All-or-Nothing), while under the flexible funding mechanism, the creators could keep all the raised pledges irrespective of whether the project succeeds or not (Keep-it-All). We show that the fixed and the flexible funding mechanisms have their own advantages under certain circumstances. Specifically, according to the basic model built for these two funding mechanisms, under each mechanism, we investigate the pledging strategies of the backers as well as the expected profit of the creator (e.g., the creator prefers flexible funding when the unit pledging cost is relatively low). Subsequently, we generalize our models by considering the product qualities. In addition to the main results consistent with those derived in the basic model, we also find some new interesting results, for example, the creator will always provide the backers with higher-quality products under the flexible funding mechanism when the product quality level is endogenous. Finally, we provide several interesting extensions of our studies on the fixed and the flexible funding mechanisms, including the following cases wherein: (i) the warmglow takes effect, (ii) the number and the types of backers varies, (iii) the platform reacts to the flexible funding mechanism, and (iv) the backer’s valuation follows normal distribution. These investigations can
effectively guide the decision makers during the crowdfunding activities.","OR in marketing, Crowdfunding, The fixed and the flexible funding mechanisms",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2019.05.019
4,2019,Winter Simulation Conference (会议),Rate Analysis For Offline Simulation Online Application,Siyang Gao; Cheng Li; Jianzhong Du,"We consider a recently proposed simulation-based decision-making framework, called offline-simulation-online-application (OSOA). In this framework, simulation experiments are not performed after the target problem is set up with all the input parameters; instead, they are performed before that with all the possible parameters that might come up in the target problem. Then, these computational results are directly used in real time for system evaluation or system optimization when the input parameters of the target problem are known. In this paper, we follow this framework and use stochastic kriging (SK) to model the system performance from the covariate space. Two measures, namely IMSE and IPFS, are proposed to evaluate the prediction errors for system evaluation and system optimization respectively. We establish the convergence rates of these two measures. They quantify the magnitude of prediction errors for the online application after a certain period of time is spent for the offline simulation.","Predictive models, Kernel, Computational modeling, Stochastic processes, System performance, Optimization",https://doi.org/10.1109/WSC40007.2019.9004834
5,2020,European Journal of Operational Research,Profit allocation in investment-based crowdfunding with investors of dynamic entry times,"Yunshen Yang, Gongbing Bi, Lindong Liu*","Even distribution is a normal profit allocation mechanism for investment-based crowdfunding projects on many platforms. In other words, the investors with the same pledging funds will be paid evenly when the investment ends. The even allocation mechanism works well under the assumption that the investors arrive at the platform simultaneously. However, in practice, the investors are sequential, therefore, the stories are different when considering the dynamic entry times of the investors. In this paper, we study ways to design appropriate profit allocation mechanisms to enhance the success rate of an investmentbased crowdfunding project. The basic model focuses on the two-investor case, where only two investors with dynamic entry times are considered. The profit allocation mechanism is shown to have great impacts on the pledging probabilities of investors, as well as the success rate of a project. After that, we shift our focus to the two-cohort case, where dynamic investors are assumed to arrive at the platform as two sequential cohorts. By taking the sizes of each cohort into consideration, we are able to analyze the success rate of a project under various practical situations. Finally, we implement some numerical experiments to generalize our studies to the situations where (i) there are more than two pledging periods for the investors, (ii) the herding effect of the investors is considered, and (iii) the valuations of the investors are assumed to be normally distributed. Our main results still hold under these general situations.","Decision analysis, Profit allocation, Success rate, Investment-based crowdfunding",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2019.07.016
6,2020,Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,Scheduling the distribution of blood products: A vendor-managed inventory routing approach,"Liu,Wenqian;Ke,Ginger Y;Chen,Jian;Zhang,Lianmin*","Blood shortage may lead to immeasurable losses. But the perishable nature of blood products limits the possibility of storing a large amount of it, and the quality of blood products reduces rapidly with transportation time. Specifically, in China, the management of blood products is even more complicated due to the significant demand for clinical blood, which increases every single year because of the reformation of the health system and the resulting scale expansion of hospitals. In this research, we aim to optimize the blood product scheduling scheme by constructing a vendor-managed inventory routing problem (VMIRP) for blood products, which balances the supply and demand such that the relevant operational cost is minimized. Then a decomposition-based algorithm is developed to solve the proposed mathematical model efficiently. Based on a series of numerical experiments of platelets, we obtain and examine the distribution plan and optimal transportation path over the planning horizon. In addition to the illustrated high algorithm efficiency, the computation results show that the VMIRP scheme can considerably decrease the operational cost of the blood supply chain.",Blood supply chain; Decomposition-based algorithm; Inventory routing problem; Platelet,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2020.101964

This paper studies a crowdsourcing contest in which a sponsor seeks solutions from a number ofindependent contestants. Specifically, we reveal how the number of contestants affects the expected effort and maximum quality in a crowdsourcing contest. First, we show that an effort-decreasing effect exists for any number of winners when there are a number of contestants, while an effort-increasing effect may occur when there are relatively few contestants. Second, we find that the expected maximum quality at most concavely increases with the number of contestants. Finally, we extend the analysis to the case with a flexible number of contributors. Our results imply that a restricted-entry policy should be adopted if the entry cost is considered, which is not observed in the prior literature.","crowdsourcing contests, incentive, entry policy, random shock",https://doi.org/10.1111/itor.12883
8,2021,Omega,Supply chain with random yield and financing,"Xiaoyong Yuan, Gongbing Bi*, Yalei Fei, Lindong Liu","In this paper, we consider a supply chain consisting of a well-capitalized manufacturer, a well-capitalized and reliable supplier, and a capital-constrained and unreliable supplier with random yield. The interactive relationship among them is modeled as a Stackelberg game with the manufacturer as the leader and the suppliers as the followers. The optimal production quantity of the suppliers and ordering quantity of the manufacturer are derived. We investigate the manufacturer’s optimal sourcing strategy considering a fixed interest rate. The analytical model shows that when external financing is available, the optimal sourcing strategy depends on the interest rate threshold. Specifically, if the interest rate is lower than the threshold, the unreliable channel dominates; otherwise, the reliable channel dominates. When financing is not available and the supply price of the reliable supplier is high, dual-channel sourcing is the optimal choice. Computational studies are performed to explore the impacts of the initial capital and the interest rate on the optimal decisions and profits. It shows capital constraint does not always decrease the attraction of the unreliable supplier for the manufacturer. Actually the attraction of using an unreliable supplier can increase if the interest rate is low or the initial capital of the unreliable supplier is small. Several extensions are considered in this paper. We show the attraction of the unreliable supplier for the manufacturer will increase if the sourcing price from the unreliable supplier is endogenously determined by the manufacturer or the demand is random.","Supply chain finance, Random yield, Capital shortage, Channel preference",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omega.2020.102334

By incorporating some Lagrangian relaxation techniques, we develop an approach for computing feasible subsidy–penalty pairs under which the grand coalition is stabilized in unbalanced cooperative games. This approach is particularly applicable when the characteristic functions of a cooperative game involve intractable integer programmes. To illustrate the performance of the Lagrangian relaxation based approach, we investigate the rooted travelling salesman game, and the computational results obtained show that our new approach is both efficient and effective.","Cooperative game, Travelling salesman game, Cost allocation",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00186-022-00771-3

The objective of this paper is to design a sequential recovery schedule such that the summation of waiting time and transportation cost of all customers to regain service is minimized. For such a sequential disruption recovery problem, we consider two situations: sequential disruption recovery for uncapacitated facilities (SDRUF) and sequential disruption recovery for capacitated facilities (SDRCF). We model the corresponding optimization problems as integer linear programs, and propose two heuristic algorithms for each situation, based on both Lagrangian relaxation and greedy method, to generate feasible solutions. In the end, computational experiments are carried out to implement the proposed heuristic algorithms. The computational results show that the two heuristic algorithms are efficient and effective for solving the SDRUF and the SDRCF problems, and act as good alternatives for each other based on problem size.","Sequential disruption recovery, Uncapacitated and capacitated facility location, Integer linear program, Lagrangian relaxation, Greedy method",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2021.107866

13,2022,Manufacturing & Service Operations Management,A Theory of Interior Peaks: Activity Sequencing and Selection for Service Design,"Yifu Li,Tinglong Dai,Xiangtong Qi","Problem definition:?Putting customer experience at the heart of service design has become a governing principle of today’s “experience economy.” Echoing this principle, our paper addresses a service designer’s problem of how to select and sequence activities in designing a service package.?Academic/practical relevance:?Empirical literature shows an ideal sequence often entails an?interior peak; that is, the peak (i.e., highest-utility) activity is placed neither at the beginning nor the end of the package. Theoretic literature, by contrast, advocates placing the peak activity either at the beginning or at the end. Our paper bridges this gap by developing a theory accounting for interior peaks. It also provides managerial implications for activity sequencing and selection.?Methodology:?We model the activity sequencing and selection problem as a nonlinear optimization problem and reformulate its objective as an additive function to generate structural insights.?Results:?We show that heterogeneity in memory decay explains the phenomenon of interior peaks. The optimal sequence is in either an “IU” or “UI” shape. An interior peak is optimal when the memory decay rate of the peak activity is neither too high nor too low.?Managerial implications:?Our research sheds light on service sequencing by weighing the phenomenon of interior peaks. In the presence of an interior peak, we show it is optimal to schedule a low point immediately before or after the peak activity, creating a contrast in customer experience. In addition, interior peaks arise partly because the peak activity is more memorable than others. Guided by this logic, as the peak activity becomes even more memorable, one might be tempted to move it to an earlier slot; we show that, counterintuitively, moving it to a later slot can be optimal. Our research also provides implications for activity selection by showing the optimal portfolio may consist of activities with the highest- and lowest-utility values but not those with medium values.",service design ，activity selection ，memory decay ，acclimation ，service operations ，people-centric operations,https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2021.0970
14,2022,European Journal of Operational Research,A geometric branch-and-bound algorithm for the service bundle design problem,"Yifu Li*,Xiangtong Qi","In the service industry, a service provider may sell a collection of service activities as a package, also known as a service bundle. Empirical studies indicate that the customer’s ex-post perception of a service bundle depends on not only the utility of each activity, but also the sequence of the activities being delivered. The latter can be measured by certain sequence effects, such as the utility of the peak activity, the utility of the end activity, and the trend of utility change over the activities. This phenomenon gives a service provider an opportunity to optimize a service bundle by manipulating the activities and their sequence. Such a service bundle design problem can be formulated as a 0–1 sum-of-ratios problem. To solve the problem, we design a novel geometric branch-and-bound algorithm. The algorithm divides the objective function into several dimensions, and repeatedly strengthens the bounds of each dimension. This enables us to convert the 0–1 sum-of-ratios problem into a series of 0–1 quadratic optimization problems. Computational experiments show that the algorithm can solve the service bundle design problem efficiently.","Scheduling,Service design,Geometric branch-and-bound algorithm 0-1 Sum-of-ratios problem",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2022.03.044
15,2022,Production and Operations Management,Service Operations for Mixed Autonomous Paradigm: Lane Design and Subsidy,"Lan Lu,ZhengZhu,Pengfei Guo,Qiao-Chu He*","This study aims to examine and design operational strategies for mixed flows of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human‐driven vehicles (HVs). We propose a stylized model wherein utilitarian individuals either drive HVs or take privately operated AVs that are collectively dispatched. In the baseline mixed policy where AVs and HVs share the same lanes, we find that AVs under‐join the traffic (queue) while HVs over‐join. We identify a “crowding‐out effect” such that AVs will tend to mitigate the over‐joining HVs and reduce overall congestion/throughput. To improve the traffic efficiency of the baseline mixed policy, we consider a fully dedicated policy in which both AVs and HVs are segregated to different lanes and a partially dedicated policy in which only AVs enjoy dedicated lanes. We find that dedicated policies outperform the mixed policy in both social welfare and the aggregate throughput when the platooning effect is moderate or strong. Exact conditions are derived for the selection of fully dedicated policy and partially dedicated policy. Furthermore, we find that a carefully designed subsidy is necessary for the dedicated policy to simultaneously improve the social welfare and the throughput when the platooning effect is very weak. These results shed interesting light on the policy regulation for the emerging mixed autonomous paradigm: a dedicated policy with proper lane design and subsidy (if necessary) will improve both social welfare and aggregate throughput.",,https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.13633

In this paper, we aim to improve the efficiency of faulty bike maintenance by predicting faulty bikes in order to make better maintenance assignment decisions. Inspired by industry practice, we identify the role of “black holes” in accurate predictions of faulty bikes: locations with morbidly high faulty rates, which can be characterized using data-driven approaches (clustering and convex hull). Based on the prediction result, we propose two maintenance policies, i.e., the pooling model and the dedicated model, for the faulty bike maintenance assignment problem with the objective of minimizing the sum of maintenance time cost and travel time cost. Finally, we provide a tractable reformulation via linear mix-integer Second-Order Conic Programming (SOCP) and conduct a case study with real data. Our analysis identifies the main trade-off between routing efficiency and maintenance efficiency in the different maintenance policies. We find that the pooling policy concentrates on routing efficiency while the dedicated policy emphasizes maintenance efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of “black holes” in the prediction of faulty bikes. In the case study, we observe that bikes in “black holes” are about?70%?more likely to be faulty than those out of “black holes.” We find that the improvement due to prediction is significant even when the prediction is imperfect.

18,2023,Journal of Management Science and Engineering,A branch-and-price algorithm to perform single-machine scheduling for additive manufacturing,"Lindong Liu, Zhenyu Wu, Yugang Yu*","Additive manufacturing (AM) has attracted significant attention in recent years based on its wide range of applications and growing demand. AM offers the advantages of production flexibility and design freedom. In this study, we considered a practical variant of the batch-processing-machine (BPM) scheduling problem that arises in AM industries, where an AM machine can process multiple parts simultaneously, as long as the twodimensional rectangular packing constraint is not violated. Based on the set-partitioning formulation of our mixed-integer programming (MIP) model, a branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm was developed by embedding a column-generation technique into a branchand-bound framework. Additionally, a novel labelling algorithm was developed to accelerate the column-generation process. Ours is the first study to provide a B&P algorithm to solve the BPM scheduling problem in the AM industry. We tested the performance of our algorithm using a modern MIP solver (Gurobi) and real data from a 3D printing factory. The results demonstrate that for most instances tested, our algorithm produces results similar or identical to those of Gurobi with reasonable computation time and outperforms Gurobi in terms of solution quality and running time on some large instances.","Single-machine scheduling, Branch and price, Labelling algorithm, Additive manufacturing",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmse.2022.10.001
19,2023,Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,Crowdfunding or traditional mode? Strategy choices in product selling,"Shengshuo Xu, Liuyi Ling*, Shaofu Du, Lindong Liu","This study examines two selling strategies, namely, crowdfunding and traditional selling. Under traditional selling, the production behavior of the creator occurs before the purchases by consumers. In this case, the demand is uncertain, and the creator’s production behavior is affected by the initial funding level. Under crowdfunding, the production behavior of the creator comes after the consumers have provided funding. In this case, consumers bear the opportunity cost, and the campaign succeeds (leading to production) only when the market demand exceeds a threshold value. In the basic model, we investigate the pricing strategy and the expected profit of the creator for each selling strategy. Our analysis reveals that crowdfunding dominates traditional selling when the creator’s initial funding is low, or the unit production cost is high. We then generalize our models by considering product quality, providing main results consistent with those derived in the basic model but also revealing new and interesting insights. For example, in the case of endogenous product quality, the creator prefers a low production volume under traditional selling, and the opportunity cost has a large (small) impact on crowdfunding (traditional selling). Finally, we examine several extensions to our studies, including adopting Keep-It-All model for crowdfunding, the case involving multiple potential consumers, and the case where the consumer’s valuation follows a normal distribution. Our paper highlights that crowdfunding, as a method of collecting finance, is also advantageous for creators with sufficient initial funding under certain conditions. Conclusions from these investigations can guide creators during their sales planning.","OR in marketing, Crowdfunding, Traditional selling, Opportunity cost",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2022.103011

In this paper, we study an alternative instrument, referred to as cost adjustment, that does not need to impose any new coalition-specific cost terms. Specifi-cally, our approach is to adjust existing cost coefficients of the game under which (i) the game becomes balanced so that the grand coalition becomes stable, (ii) a desired way of cooperation is optimal for the grand coalition to adopt, and (iii) the total cost to be shared by the grand coalition is within a prescribed range. Focusing on a broad class of coopera-tive games, known as integer minimization games, we formulate the problem on how to optimize the cost adjustment as a constrained inverse optimization problem. We prove N P-hardness and derive easy-to-check feasibility conditions for the problem. Based on two linear programming reformulations, we develop two solution algorithms. One is a cutting-plane algorithm, which runs in polynomial time when the corresponding separa-tion problem is polynomial time solvable. The other needs to explicitly derive all the inequalities of a linear program, which runs in polynomial time when the linear program contains only a polynomial number of inequalities. We apply our models and solution algorithms to two typical unbalanced games, including a weighted matching game and an uncapacitated facility location game, showing that their optimal cost adjustments can be obtained in polynomial time.","cooperative game, grand coalition stability, cost adjustment, inverse optimization, integer minimization game, weighted matching game, uncapacitated facility location game",https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.2022.0268

To survive the highly competitive market, service providers have introduced various methods to improve the customer experience, for example, providing faster response or wider delivery coverage.

In this study, we propose a novel?territory?design method allowing the territory plan to be adjusted while guaranteeing service consistency.

In the second stage, the remaining cells are assigned to the drivers with the actual demands while taking driver experience into consideration. The computational studies reveal that the proposed TSRH method is able to resolve the TPP efficiently, and it is robust under different situations.

Each element has two critical features: a?reward?(e.g., earning an item or being able to watch a cinematic) and a degree of?difficulty?(e.g., how much energy or focus is needed to interact with the?game?element). The latter property is a distinctive feature in video?games. Unlike passive services (like a trip to the spa) or passive entertainment (like watching sports or movies), video?games?often require concerted effort to consume. We study how to?sequence?game?elements to maximize overall experienced utility subject to the dynamics of adaptation to rewards and difficulty and memory decay. We find that the?optimal?design depends on the relationship between rewards and difficulty, leading to qualitatively different designs. For example, when the proportion of reward-to-difficulty is high, the?optimal?design mimics that of more passive experiences. By contrast, the?optimal?design of?games?with low reward-to-difficulty ratios resembles work-out routines with “warm-ups” and “cool-downs.” Intermediate cases may follow the classical “mini-boss, end-boss” design where difficulty has two peaks. Numerical results reveal?optimal?designs with “waves” of reward and difficulty with multiple peaks. Level designs with multiple peaks of difficulty are ubiquitous in video?games. In summary, this paper provides practical guidance to?game?designers on how to match the design of?single-player?games?to the relationship between reward and difficulty inherent in their?game’s?mechanics. Our model also has implications for other interactive services that share similarities with?games, such as summer camps for children.","video games,level design,memory decay,adaptation",https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.4665
23,2023,Informs Journal on Computing,Convergence Analysis of Stochastic Kriging-Assisted Simulation with Random Covariates,Cheng Li;Siyang Gao*; Jianzhong Du,"We consider performing simulation experiments in the presence of covariates. Here, covariates refer to some input information other than system designs to the simulation model that can also affect the system performance. To make decisions, decision makers need to know the covariate values of the problem. Traditionally in simulation-based decision making, simulation samples are collected after the covariate values are known; in contrast, as a new framework, simulation with covariates starts the simulation before the covariate values are revealed and collects samples on covariate values that might appear later. Then, when the covariate values are revealed, the collected simulation samples are directly used to predict the desired results. This framework significantly reduces the decision time compared with the traditional way of simulation. In this paper, we follow this framework and suppose there are a finite number of system designs. We adopt the metamodel of stochastic kriging (SK) and use it to predict the system performance of each design and the best design. The goal is to study how fast the prediction errors diminish with the number of covariate points sampled. This is a fundamental problem in simulation with covariates and helps quantify the relationship between the offline simulation efforts and the online prediction accuracy. Particularly, we adopt measures of the maximal integrated mean squared error (IMSE) and integrated probability of false selection (IPFS) for assessing errors of the system performance and the best design predictions. Then, we establish convergence rates for the two measures under mild conditions. Last, these convergence behaviors are illustrated numerically using test examples.","simulation with covariates,convergence rate,stochastic kriging,ranking and selection",https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.2022.1263

In the meantime, stochastic models have been well developed in the literature for a lot of major diseases. This gives rise to a simulation-based solution for PM, which uses the simulation tool to evaluate the performance for pairs of treatment and patient biometric characteristics and, based on that, selects the best treatment for each patient characteristic.?Methodology/results:?In this research, we extend the ranking and selection (R&S) model in simulation-based decision making to solving PM. The biometric characteristics of a patient are treated as a context for R&S, and we call it contextual ranking and selection (CR&S). We consider two formulations of CR&S with small and large context spaces, respectively, and develop new techniques for solving them and identifying the rate-optimal budget allocation rules. Based on them, two selection algorithms are proposed, which can be shown to be numerically superior via a set of tests on abstract and real-world examples.?Managerial implications:?This research provides a systematic way of conducting simulation-based decision-making for PM. To improve the overall decision quality for the possible contexts, more simulation efforts should be devoted to contexts in which it is difficult to distinguish between the best treatment and non-best treatments, and our results quantify the optimal trade-off of the simulation efforts between the pairs of contexts and treatments.","personalized medicine, contextual ranking and selection, simulation optimization, OCBA, convergence rate",https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2022.0232
25,2023,Production and Operations Management,Optimizing resource allocation in service systems via simulation: A Bayesian formulation,"Chen, Weiwei*, Siyang Gao, Wenjie Chen, and Jianzhong Du","The service sector has become increasingly important in today's economy. To meet the rising expectation of high‐quality services, efficiently allocating resources is vital for service systems to balance service qualities with costs. In particular, this paper focuses on a class of resource allocation problems where the service‐level objective and constraints are in the form of probabilistic measures. Further, process complexity and system dynamics in service systems often render their performance evaluation and optimization challenging and relying on simulation models. To this end, we propose a generalized resource allocation model with probabilistic measures, and subsequently, develop an optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) formulation to select the optimal solution subject to random noises in simulation. The OCBA formulation minimizes the expected opportunity cost that penalizes based on the quality of the selected solution. Further, the formulation takes a Bayesian approach to consider the prior knowledge and potential performance correlations on candidate solutions. Then, the asymptotic optimality conditions of the formulation are derived, and an iterative algorithm is developed accordingly. Numerical experiments and a case study inspired by a real‐world problem in a hospital emergency department demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for solving the resource allocation problem via?simulation.","Bayesian model, optimal computing budget allocation, ranking and selection, resource allocation, service systems",https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.13825

However, designing a proper network is challenging due to limited information and, more importantly, the correlated demand uncertainty that exists among affected areas. We consider a network design problem for humanitarian relief purposes, where demand correlations exist and demand information is limited, i.e., only the mean demand and covariance matrix are known. Note that the covariance matrix can explicitly capture the correlated demand among areas. We formulate this problem as a mixed-integer two-stage distributionally robust location-inventory model, which is generally NP-hard and computationally intractable. The model is further reformulated as a mixed-integer conic problem based on copositive cones, and it is tractable with positive semidefinite relaxation. To accelerate the problem-solving process, we design an interpretable branching-and-pricing heuristic with a warm start. Both semi-case study and simulation results demonstrate that explicitly modelling demand correlation can decrease unmet demand.","Humanitarian relief network design,Moments-based distributionally robust optimization,Conic programming",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2023.109365

This paper presents a new multiple-purchase (MP) choice model based on the multinomial logit (MNL) choice model, which allows customers to purchase more than one item in a single visit. We first prove that the log-likelihood function based on our MP choice model has a nice concave property such that we can efficiently estimate the parameters in the model with data. Next, we present an equivalent mixed-integer program for the multiple-purchase assortment optimization, which can be solved by state-of-the-art commercial solvers. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to evaluate the benefits from the MP choice model in both estimation and optimization problems. We first conduct a?case study?on a real-world dataset. The numerical results show that our MP choice model performs better in three estimation metrics and one revenue metric than the MNL choice model. Then, we demonstrate the advantage of the MP choice model on simulated data. Our model can provide significant realized revenue improvement compared with that obtained by the single-purchase MNL choice model in numerical results.","Multiple purchase behavior,Choice model estimation,Assortment optimization",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2023.109010

given truck routes","Wenqian Liu, Lindong Liu, Xiangtong Qi*","Drones have been increasingly used for deliveries; however, delivering packages directly to customers is
still challenging, particularly in densely populated urban areas. To overcome this, drone resupply has been
proposed, where drones carry packages to trucks en route, and then trucks make the final deliveries. Existing
studies have only considered the case of one truck and one drone. In this study, we investigate drone resupply
with multiple trucks and drones for the on-time delivery of late-available packages. Considering practical
operations in urban areas, we focus on a situation where trucks deliver packages along given routes. This
raises the drone resupply scheduling problem, which aims to maximise the total value of the late-available
packages that can be delivered on time. We formally define the problem and analyse its optimality properties.
Then, we develop an exact solution approach based on a time-expanded network flow model and design a
greedy heuristic algorithm. We validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solutions through
computational studies. Operational insights and guidance are derived for the application of drones in on-time

This paper examines two incentive schemes in two-stage innovation contests: feedback and elimination. Feedback enhances the efforts by revealing the competitive status, and elimination intensifies the competition by removing less-qualified participants. We build a game theoretical model to investigate how the organizer should design the feedback and elimination schemes and then analyze the equilibrium efforts and optimal contest design in four-solver contests. The results suggest that the optimal design depends on the combined effects of the reward, effort sensitivity, and cost coefficiency. Elimination and nonelimination contests can be optimal under different conditions. Furthermore, we extend the equilibrium analysis to competitions with?n>4?contestants and investigate the optimal design with numerical studies. The most interesting result is that the elimination contest with feedback from the organizer is an ideal option for a budget-constrained enterprise that seeks an innovative solution from the public for a complex innovation project.

By leveraging the randomness of the number of potential customers, we develop a nonsequential appointment scheduling policy as an alternative to the conventional first-come-first-served (FCFS) policy. This allows for more flexibility in managing appointment scheduling. To calculate the optimal policy, we develop a branch-and-bound algorithm in which the lower bound is estimated using multiple approaches, such as optimality conditions, dynamic programming for calculating FCFS policy, and the shortest path reformulation. Through numerical studies, we observe that nonsequential appointment scheduling is particularly advantageous in systems characterized by highly fluctuating customer numbers or low congestion. In such cases, leaving gaps between appointments for potential future arrivals proves to be a more appropriate strategy. We also evaluate the performance of heuristics proposed in prior literature and provide insights into situations where these heuristics can be effectively applied.","Appointment scheduling, dynamic, nonsequential, branch and bound, shortest path",https://doi.org/10.1177/10591478231224926

The objective is to determine a scheduling sequence that exhibits strong out-of-sample performance. To achieve this, we employ target-oriented robust satisficing models to obtain the scheduling sequence. For the scheduling problem with deterministic release times, we derive an equivalent mixed-integer linear program and an approximate reformulation to address cases involving a large number of jobs. For the scheduling problem with random release times, we first demonstrate the challenges associated with providing an equivalent reformulation. To overcome this intractability, we propose an approximate reformulation based on the linear decision rule. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our solutions through comparisons with several benchmarks. Furthermore, the numerical results demonstrate that a relatively higher target should be chosen if the worst-case performance is valued, otherwise, the decision-maker should set a relatively lower target to obtain better average performance.","Robust machine scheduling,Random release time,Random processing time,Robust satisficing",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2024.106642

It has extensive applications in common combinatorial optimization, such as vehicle routing and scheduling, where each iteration involves solving a constrained shortest path problem, which is NP-hard. While heuristic acceleration methods exist, they often lack versatility across different problem domains. This study proposes RLHH, a reinforcement learning-based hyper-heuristic framework that enhances CG by integrating a selection module to accelerate convergence and improve integer solutions. At each CG iteration, the RL agent selects a low-level heuristic to construct a reduced network, retaining only the most promising edges. We apply RLHH to two combinatorial optimization problems – Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) and Bus Driver Scheduling Problem (BDSP) – achieving up to 27.9% and 15.4% cost reductions, respectively, compared to the best standalone heuristic, with similar or lower computational costs. Furthermore, we demonstrate successful transfer learning from VRPTW to BDSP through pretraining and fine-tuning, reducing training costs significantly while maintaining performance. RLHH is the first RL-based CG method that outperforms traditional approaches in terms of solution quality, underscoring its potential to enhance CG-based optimization in various domains.",Column generation; Reinforcement learning; Hyper-heuristic; Vehicle routing problems; Bus Driver Scheduling Problems,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2025.111138

Advancements in manufacturing technology have reshaped the traditional make-to-order model, enabling better resource coordination, supply chain optimisation, and production flexibility. This paper tackles cooperative logistics optimisation for additive manufacturing by targeting systematic cost reduction and fair allocation. We develop a mixed-integer linear programming model that integrates production, inventory, and transportation costs while optimising order assignment, inventory transshipment, and centralised raw material procurement. Two coalition models for cost allocation are examined: one involving both manufacturers and retailers and another comprising only additive manufacturing manufacturers. The former may lead to empty core scenarios, whereas the latter guarantees a stable cost allocation mechanism. To address the empty core issue, we propose an exact row-generation algorithm along with a hybrid approach that combines linear and Lagrangian relaxations. Experiments reveal that the exact method suits small-scale problems, whereas the hybrid approach performs better on large-scale problems, offering valuable insights into logistics cost optimisation for cooperative make-to-order additive manufacturing.",cooperative game; Lagrangian relaxation; Logistics optimisation; optimal cost allocation problem; row generation,https://doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2025.2513018

The platform’s service mode, the willingness of seekers to match, and providers’ carbon emission reduction (CER) directly affect entities’ decisions. Therefore, this paper employs an evolutionary game approach to analyse the manufacturing resource matching (MRM) between the providers and seekers and a sequential game model to analyse the pricing and CER strategies between the platform and providers. First, this study reveals that the service mode does not influence the evolutionary path and stability of MRM. However, matching in the cooperative mode becomes easier due to higher resource quantities. Second, we find that the cooperative mode can enhance the system’s profits, and an appropriate revenue-sharing ratio is crucial for the platform and providers. Third, the analysis indicates that while the cooperative model can generate higher profits, it may also result in increased total carbon emissions.",Manufacturing outsourcing ，manufacturing resource matching ，carbon emission reduction ，service mode selection ，evolutionary game,https://doi.org/10.1080/01605682.2024.2392797

However, counterintuitively, some sellers, particularly those who sell online, purposefully increase the hassle cost of purchasing their products. Our work examines how sellers effectively apply dual?pricing?with purchase hassle to increase their profit and how it affects consumers' purchasing decisions and utility. Different from previous studies, we take into account both the heterogeneities of consumers' product valuations and hassle costs. We find that when consumers' hassle costs are independent of their product valuations, decrease or concavely increase in the product valuations, dual pricing with purchase hassle reduces sellers' profits. When consumers' hassle costs are convex increasing in their product valuations and the relative increasing rate is high, sellers can obtain additional profit through dual pricing. Moreover, under dual pricing, consumers' utility is non-monotonic in their product valuations. Finally, we extend our model to the case where the former full price is kept while switching to dual pricing, the case with network effects, the case where the cost to sellers of offering dual pricing is higher than single pricing, as well as the implications on?consumer surplus.

In this paper, to further improve the procedure's performance in solving large-scale problems, we propose a major modification of the procedure. Specifically, in each round of the selection, before pairing the surviving alternatives and conducting the matches, we first choose an alternative as the reference alternative and then add the reference alternative to each match. We call the new procedure Procedure i-KT, where i-KT stands for “improved knockout-tournament”. We show that by carefully choosing the reference alternative and designing the pairing scheme for the remaining surviving alternatives in each round of the selection, Procedure i-KT can achieve significant improvements on both the average sample size required in each match and the total number of matches required during the entire selection process.

In the context of direct meal delivery using drones, it is a common practice to replace the drone's battery after each round trip between the central launch site and customer locations to prevent power interruptions. This practice can lead to frequent battery replacements, resulting in increased downtime and decreased drone utilization. To enhance the efficiency of drone delivery, we take into account load-dependent energy consumption for the drones and optimize battery replacement along with drone scheduling. A mixed integer programming formulation is constructed to mathematically capture the problem. Additionally, we develop a time-expanded network flow method and a tailored hybrid variable neighborhood search algorithm to solve the problem exactly and heuristically. Computational studies validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed operational model and solution approaches. The results indicate that optimizing battery replacement can induce an increase in on-time deliveries by up to 7.69% compared to replacing batteries after each return, and by 14.29% compared to only replacing them when energy levels are low. Such benefits are particularly significant in scenarios with tighter delivery deadlines and longer battery replacement times.",Battery replacement; Drone delivery; Online meal delivery; Time-expanded network flow,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2025.107295

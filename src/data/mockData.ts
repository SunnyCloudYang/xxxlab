    authors: ["Lindong Liu", "Xiangtong Qi*", "Zhou Xu"],
    venue: "INFORMS Journal on Computing",
    year: 2016,
    type: "journal",
    abstract:
      "For a cost-sharing cooperative game with an empty core, we study the problem of calculating a near-optimal cost allocation that satisfies coalitional stability constraints and maximizes the total cost allocated to all players. One application of such a problem is finding the minimum level of subsidy required to stabilize the grand coalition. To obtain solutions, we propose a new generic framework based on Lagrangian relaxation, which has several advantages over existing work that exclusively relies on linear programming (LP) relaxation techniques.",

    type: "journal",
    abstract:
      "In this paper we propose a new instrument, a simultaneous penalization and subsidization, for stabilizing the grand coalition and enabling cooperation among all players of an unbalanced cooperative game. The basic idea is to charge a penalty z from players who leave the grand coalition, and at the same time provide a subsidy ω to players who stay in the grand coalition.",

      "This study examines two types of crowdfunding mechanisms, namely, the fixed and the flexible funding mechanisms. Under the fixed funding mechanism, the pledges are returned to the backers if the crowdfunding project fails (All-or-Nothing), while under the flexible funding mechanism, the creators could keep all the raised pledges irrespective of whether the project succeeds or not (Keep-it-All).",

      "We consider a recently proposed simulation-based decision-making framework, called offline-simulation-online-application (OSOA). In this framework, simulation experiments are not performed after the target problem is set up with all the input parameters; instead, they are performed before that with all the possible parameters that might come up in the target problem.",

    venue: "European Journal of Operational Research",
    year: 2020,
    type: "journal",
    abstract:
      "Even distribution is a normal profit allocation mechanism for investment-based crowdfunding projects on many platforms. In other words, the investors with the same pledging funds will be paid evenly when the investment ends. The even allocation mechanism works well under the assumption that the investors arrive at the platform simultaneously. However, in practice, the investors are sequential, therefore, the stories are different when considering the dynamic entry times of the investors.",
